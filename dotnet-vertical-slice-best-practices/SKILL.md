# .NET Backend Vertical Slice

Use this skill when backend code needs to be planned, implemented, devops, databases, or refined in a .NET application that follows a vertical-slice style.

## Core rule

Keep behavior local to the use case, preserve stable API contracts, and treat persistence, validation,
error handling, and migrations as part of the same backend change.

## Working flow

1. Inspect the repository structure and preserve valid local conventions (naming patterns, folder structures, and coding standards).
2. Identify the affected use case, route, request, response, and persistence impact. If multiple slices are affected, ensure consistency across all impacted slices.
3. Minimize logic in the transport layer (endpoint registration, HTTP result mapping, and request deserialization); keep all business logic and validation within the same handler or module associated with the slice.
4. Address concerns in this priority order (adjust if a migration or persistence change is a prerequisite for the change):
   - First: validation rules and expected failure paths.
   - Second: authorization and ownership checks.
   - Third: migrations and persistence changes.
5. Load the references that apply using the decision table below:

   | Task involves…                                                                 | Load this reference              |
   |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Minimal APIs, route groups, HTTP result mapping, or OpenAPI                    | dotnet-minimal-api.md            |
   | Commands, queries, handlers, or MediatR slices                                  | dotnet-cqrs-slice.md             |
   | Startup composition, project boundaries, or solution-wide build/package defaults | dotnet-solution-topology.md      |
   | Dedicated migrator or containerized local backend startup                        | dotnet-migrations-project.md; create or update `compose.yml` so `docker compose up` runs dependencies and migrations in order |
   | GitHub Actions build workflows, release images, or backend/migrator artifact versioning | devops-github.md |
   | Modernization or version-sensitive upgrades                                     | dotnet-platform-baseline.md (load before recommending upgrades) |

6. For .NET 10 AppHost work, check whether the change should include SDK pinning, real health
   checks, OpenAPI build artifacts, fluent request validation, or centralized `ProblemDetails`
   metadata.
7. Run the most relevant verification for the touched backend surface.

## Required checklist

For every meaningful backend change, reason through the following categories in order:

**1. Use Case and Contracts** (start here)
- slice or feature affected;
- command or query semantics;
- endpoint and route behavior;
- request and response contracts;

**2. Validation and Authorization**
- validation rules;
- expected business errors;
- authorization and ownership checks;

**3. Persistence and Migrations**
- persistence impact;
- migration impact;

**4. Composition and Caller Impact**
- host/composition or solution-boundary impact when relevant;
- caller impact.
